# Flappy Bird

Flappy Bird game is made with Java. In this project, I added an interface that will show the GUI game named Flappy Bird. Users can click on the Play button to play the game. Then a new window will open for the Flappy Bird game. It is not my first Java Project on games.

# About The Game:
Flappy Bird is a popular 2D side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird and tries to navigate it through a series of obstacles, consisting of green pipes. The objective is to make the bird fly as far as possible without colliding with any pipes.

In this game, the bird is constantly falling due to gravity, and the player's input is used to control its vertical movement. By tapping the spacebar or the screen, the player can make the bird flap its wings, causing it to ascend temporarily. The challenge lies in timing the flaps correctly to maneuver the bird through the gaps in the pipes.

This game is implemented using the Java programming language. It utilizes graphics libraries like Java Swing to create the game's graphical user interface. The bird, pipes, and background are rendered on the screen, and collision detection is performed to detect if the bird collides with any pipes.

This game keeps track of the player's score, which increases as the bird successfully passes through each pair of pipes. If the bird collides with a pipe or touches the ground, the game is over, and the player can choose to restart and try again.

Overall, Flappy Bird is a challenging and addictive game that tests the player's reflexes and precision. It’s simple yet engaging gameplay mechanics have made it a popular choice among gamers of all ages. I am so proud that at last I created this kind of game project.
